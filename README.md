# NumWorks Graphing Calculator Python Math Libraries

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d6fab4d62ede4fb0915a6b055b4402b7)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/one-and-only/numworks-math-libs?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=one-and-only/numworks-math-libs&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

This piece of software is a python script that has the ability to do various mathematical calculations that would otherwise be tedious doing traditionally using pencil or a normal calculator. This script is targeted towards the NumWorks ```N0110```, and not the ```N0100``` (although it may be compatible). The main driver for this decision was the 8x increase in flash storage on the ```N0110``` (8MB vs 1MB on the ```N0100```). As I do not have a NumWorks ```N0110``` on hand, I will be targetting a maximum size of 4MB for the Python Script. This is half of the calculator's total storage capacity. If you know of an exact *AVAILABLE* size after installation of just the Operating System, please let me know through an issue on this repository. I will be using the [online simulator](https://www.numworks.com/simulator/) to test the script.

this piece of software is not exam approved and I am not responsible for any penalties for using it in any manner, including, but not limited to, school exams, tests, etc.
