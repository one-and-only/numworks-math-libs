# NumWorks Graphing Calculator Python Math Libraries
This piece of software is a python script that has the ability to do various mathematical calculations that would otherwise be tedious doing traditionally using pencil or a normal calculaasefator. This script is targeted towards the NumWorks ```N0110```, and not the ```N0100``` (although it may be compatible). The main driver for this decisionsdfaximum size of 4MB for the Python Script. This is half of the calculator's total storage capacity. If you know of an exact *AVAILABLE* size after installation of sdfsadasdfasdfasdfdsfjust the Operating System, please let me know through an issue on this repository. I will be using the [online simulator](https://www.numworks.com/simulator/) to test the script.
